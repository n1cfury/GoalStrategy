# GoalStrategy
A detailed strategy I put together for crushing goals.
 
Mission:  
I wanted to come up with an efficient way of tracking and focusing any studying/work I do off-hours that may or may not be directly related to my job.

Problem:
While I would consider myself fairly creative with ways to get from point A to point B in terms of getting things done, I tend to occasionally spend too much time in planning or Ideation mode, more commonly referred to as "paralysis through analysis"

Solution:
Create a system I can use that enables me to build my skills, wasting the least amount of time.  It took me nearly two years to get around to finishing the book [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280), so finding a way that works for me has been rather effective.

How it works:
There are two spreadsheets in the file that are separated by design to keep the focus simple and it would've been a mess to keep everything on one page.  I will update this as I progress.

	Stragetic Guide
	Each category is ranked per metric.  The best part is, once I put everything together it has been really simple.  
	I will evaluate my progress and the system at the end of the year and adjust if needed.  
	Basically, I used the CARVER matrix to determine the 'how' for this list, and the SMART system to define
	what I want to measure.
	I then came up with a handful of topics asking "what do I want to be working toward".  
	By giving them a quantitative value, it eliminated any bias.  With everything added up, I now
	have a value to rank each category.  Since a couple of them were tied I chose the one with a more tangible
	value.

	Tactical Guide
	This shows active tasks for each month.  Unless an item has a definitive date (e.g. conferences), 
	I dont create new tasks until the first weekend of a new month.  
	When tasks are completed, they are highlighed green and the points are added up and accumulated 
	during the year (as of Nov 2016)
	Items in gray are thought of ahead of time but changed to black during the first weekend of that month.  
	If an item isn't completed at the end of month I avoid rolling it over to prevent procrastination.  
	There's enough stuff to do each month, however this isn't meant to get a perfect score.  
	Scoring too high may mean I either set tasks that were too easy, 
	or didn't challenge myself enough.  

Sources and Takeaways:
First, I have to give credit where credit is due to [@sneakerhax](https://twitter.com/sneakerhax) for the idea of creating a system to clearly define a progression map of skills, the one thing I decided after looking at his system was to create my own.  

The [SMART Review](https://www.cleverbridge.com/corporate/5-elements-of-smart-performance-reviews/)
This is partially based on the SMART Review system used by some Fortune 500 companies.  I found this system effective because it clearly defined how to set a goal and what gives each goal value.  Aside from this, I wanted to mold this system on the premise of evaluating my progress at the end of the year.

The [CARVER Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARVER_matrix)
I discovered the CARVER matrix after reading the book [Unleash the Warrior Within](https://www.amazon.com/Unleash-Warrior-Within-Discipline-Confidence/dp/0738215686).  While the one I'm using is a slight variation, it recognizes that different categories can rank things differently.  This also helps in situations where multiple things are "high priority".  This was specifically used to rank each SMART category.

The take away from this is I am sharing my system to demonstrate what works "FOR ME".  Whether or not this system works for you, I highly recommend you building your own system.  In fact if you want to get the most out of this I advise you to come up with something that makes sense to you.  A simple copy/paste of things you want to do in this system wont prove as effective.
