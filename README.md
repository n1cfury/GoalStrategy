# GoalStrategy
A detailed strategy I put together for crushing goals.
 
Mission:  
I wanted to come up with an efficient way of tracking and focusing any studying/work I do off-hours that may or may not be directly related to my job.

Problem:
While I would consider myself fairly creative with ways to get from point A to point B in terms of getting things done, I tend to occasionally spend too much time in planning or Ideation mode, more commonly referred to as "paralysis through analysis"

Solution:
Create a system I can use that enables me to build my skills, wasting the least amount of time.  It took me nearly two years to get around to finishing the book [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280), so finding a way that works for me has been rather effective.

How it works:
There are two spreadsheets in the file that are separated by design to keep the focus simple and it would've been a mess to keep everything on one page.

	Stragetic Guide	
	Each category is ranked per metric.  The beauty of this is once I put all of this together the first time, I didnt need to keep reminding myself of how it worked, and I will evaluate my progress and the system at the end of the year.  Basically, I used the CARVER matrix to determine the 'how' for this list, and the SMART system for the 'what' to measure.  I then came up with a handful of topics to focus on and determined from top to bottom what they ranked for each SMART category.  By giving them a quantitative value, it eliminated any bias.  Now that everything has a point total, I highlighted them based on highest to lowest (green to red)
		
	Tactical Guide	
	This shows active tasks for each month.  Unless an item has a definitive date (e.g. conferences), I dont create new tasks until the first weekend of a new month.  When tasks are completed, they are highlighed green and the points are added up.  The percentages indicate precentage of completion throughout the year, in which case I started this November 2016.	Items in gray are thought of ahead of time but changed to black during the first weekend of that month.  If an item isn't completed at the end of the month its not highlighted and does not roll over to the next month to prevent procrastination.  There's enough stuff to do each month, and to the contrary, if I were to somehow finish 100% of the tasks, it would indicate I'm not challenging myself

Sources and Takeaways:
First, I have to give credit where credit is due to @sneakerhax for the idea of creating a system to clearly define a progression map of skills, the one thing I decided after looking at his system was to create my own.  

The [SMART Review](https://www.cleverbridge.com/corporate/5-elements-of-smart-performance-reviews/)
This is partially based on the SMART Review system used by some Fortune 500 companies.  I found this system effective because it clearly defined how to set a goal and what gives each goal value.  Aside from this, I wanted to mold this system on the premise of evaluating my progress at the end of the year.

The [CARVER Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARVER_matrix)
I discovered the CARVER matrix after reading the book [Unleash the Warrior Within](https://www.amazon.com/Unleash-Warrior-Within-Discipline-Confidence/dp/0738215686).  While the one I'm using is a slight variation, it recognizes that different categories can rank things differently.  This also helps in situations where multiple things are "high priority".  This was specifically used to rank each SMART category.

The take away from this is I am sharing my system to demonstrate what works "FOR ME".  Whether or not this system works for you, I highly recommend you building your own system.  In fact if you want to get the most out of this I advise you to come up with something that makes sense to you.  A simple copy/paste of things you want to do in this system wont prove as effective.
